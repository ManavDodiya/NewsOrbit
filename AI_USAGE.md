# AI Usage Documentation

## Project: NewsOrbit

This document explains how AI assistance was used during the development of the **NewsOrbit Android application**. It clarifies where AI contributed, what was accepted or modified, what was rejected, and how human judgment influenced the final implementation.

---

## Overview

The NewsOrbit project was developed with significant AI assistance primarily for project scaffolding, API integration, and architectural guidance. All generated output was reviewed, tested, and refined before inclusion in the final application.

The goal was to accelerate development while maintaining modern Android best practices such as MVVM architecture, clean code organization, and offline-first data handling.

## AI Tools Used

**Primary Tool**

- Antigravity AI coding assistant  
  - Architecture suggestions  
  - API integration scaffolding  
  - Boilerplate code generation  
  - Documentation drafting  

**Usage Scope**

- Initial code generation and structure
- Debugging assistance
- Documentation refinement

---

## Where AI Was Used (Files / Modules)

### 1. Project Architecture & Planning
- MVVM architecture setup  
- Package structuring (`data`, `domain`, `ui`)  
- Dependency injection configuration  
- Navigation flow planning  

---

### 2. Data Layer

**Files**

- `data/remote/NewsApiService.kt`  
- `data/remote/dto/*.kt`  
- `data/local/dao/ArticleDao.kt`  
- `data/local/NewsDatabase.kt`  
- `data/repository/NewsRepository.kt`  

**AI Contribution**

- Retrofit API integration  
- DTO model creation  
- Room database setup  
- Offline caching repository pattern  

---

### 3. Domain Layer

**Files**

- `domain/model/Article.kt`  
- `domain/model/Source.kt`  

**AI Contribution**

- Domain model structuring  
- Separation of concerns between layers  

---

### 4. UI Layer

**Files**

- `ui/screens/NewsListScreen.kt`  
- `ui/screens/ArticleDetailScreen.kt`  
- `ui/viewmodel/NewsViewModel.kt`  
- `ui/components/*.kt`  
- `ui/theme/*.kt`  

**AI Contribution**

- Compose UI scaffolding  
- ViewModel state handling patterns  
- Theming and component structure  

---

### 5. Build Configuration

**Files**

- `build.gradle.kts` (project & app)  
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml`  

**AI Contribution**

- Dependency setup  
- Version catalog configuration  
- Build optimization suggestions  

---

### 6. Documentation

**Files**

- `README.md`  
- `AI_USAGE.md`  

**AI Contribution**

- Initial documentation drafts  
- Formatting and structure suggestions  

---

## What AI Output Was Accepted vs Modified

### Accepted Mostly As Generated

- Retrofit API interface boilerplate  
- Basic Room database configuration  
- Initial Compose UI scaffolding  
- Gradle dependency configuration  

These components aligned with standard Android practices and required minimal changes.

---

### Modified Significantly

- Repository logic refined for cleaner offline-first flow  
- Error handling improved for stability  
- UI state management adjusted for better UX  
- Navigation and architecture refined for maintainability  

These modifications ensured production-readiness and adherence to project requirements.

---

## AI Suggestions Rejected (With Reasons)

- Over-complex networking abstractions  
  → Rejected to maintain readability and simplicity.

- Some autogenerated UI layouts  
  → Did not align with intended UX design.

- Generic error handling patterns  
  → Replaced with structured state handling.

- Certain architecture shortcuts  
  → Avoided to preserve scalability and clean architecture separation.

---

## Example of Human Improvement Over AI Output

AI initially generated API integration logic where data was fetched directly and exposed to the UI layer.

This was improved by:

- Introducing a proper repository abstraction  
- Implementing offline caching using Room  
- Refining ViewModel state handling  
- Ensuring clear separation between API, database, and UI layers  

This resulted in better maintainability, testability, and alignment with Android architectural best practices.

---

## Human Oversight & Responsibility

All AI-generated code was:

- Reviewed manually  
- Tested for functionality and stability  
- Adjusted to match project requirements  
- Checked for maintainability and scalability  

AI assistance accelerated development but final decisions remained human-driven.
